At the age of {{AGE}}, I have amassed {{EXPERIENCE}} years of comprehensive experience in JavaScript programming, mastering both front-end and backend technologies such as AngularJS, NodeJS, and PostgreSQL. As an artist by hobby, I have a particular fondness for front-end development, where I can blend my technical skills with my creative flair. My love for animals has led me to rescue and foster cats, and I take pride in my ability to handle even the most challenging felines. In my downtime, you will find me experimenting in the kitchen, engrossed in a thrilling movie, or unwinding to the tunes of rock music!",
